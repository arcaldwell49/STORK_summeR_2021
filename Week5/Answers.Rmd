# Week 5 Answers

This week's instructions were written in R now that everyone is aware of how to use Rmarkdown.

Now we get down to what R was created for: statistics. 

# Useful Packages

```{r}
# statistics pacakges
# functions simliar to tidyverse
# install.packages("easystats", repos = "https://easystats.r-universe.dev")
library(easystats)

# For ANOVAs
library(afex)

# For equivalence testing
# Download the developmental version
# devtools::install_github("arcaldwell49/TOSTER")
library(TOSTER)
```

Now, let's import the data we need for this week!

```{r}
data("sleep")
data("ChickWeight")
data("iris")
```


# Correlations


# t-test


# ANOVA
